        <h1>Let's Summarize!</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Unlike classical bits, qubits harness the properties of quantum mechanics, including superposition and entanglement, giving each bit the ability to store more complex information.</p></li>
            <li><p>In order to recreate the two-level nature of classical bits in quantum systems, scientists make use of energy quantization, which refers to the fact that quantum systems have discrete energy levels rather than a continuous spectrum of possible energies.
</p></li>
            <li><p>Quantum engineers make qubits out of synthetic atoms that display quantum properties, but on a larger scale than natural atoms.  This is possible due to the existence of superconductors, whose unique properties give current in the conductance band a wavelike quality.</p></li>
            <li><p>Most superconducting qubits are LC circuits.  LC circuits contain a capacitor and an inductor, and are an example of a simple harmonic oscillator.  Superconducting LC circuits have discrete energy levels and other quantum mechanical properties.</p></li>
            <li><p>In most superconducting qubits, Josephson Junctions act as a nonlinear inductor.  Their nonlinear nature makes it possible to only access the first two energy levels of the system.  So, superconducting qubits can act just like classical bits, but with the benefits of quantum properties!</p></li>
